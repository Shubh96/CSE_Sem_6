# CSE_Sem_6
Lab Programs for 6th Semester in the CSE BTech Program under MAKAUT at Siliguri Institute of Technology.

The programs included are for the following subjects:
* Computer Networks
* Database Management Systems
* Operating Systems

For DBMS programs only the PL/SQL code has been uploaded. The remaining dependencies would be uploaded later on as and when i get time. As of now you would have to rely on you own work. The file has .sql extensions.

Computer Networks programs have been written using Java Programming Language. It is basically socket programming which relies on port number and the java.net package.

Operating Systems programs have been written in Shell Script and in C programming Language. Both have been separated using different directories.
